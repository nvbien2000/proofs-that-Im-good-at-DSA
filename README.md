## Dear recruiter,

Thank you for taking the time to review my profile. If you're reading this, you're likely interested in learning more about me. I firmly believe that companies that prioritize candidates' **Data Structures & Algorithms** abilities are often the top-tier companies in the market. It's reassuring to know that.

As such, this repository will serve as a showcase of the achievements I've attained throughout my studies. I hope these accomplishments impress you, and perhaps even lead you to consider bypassing the LeetCode or HackerRank tests during the interview process :D Thank you!

Some IT achievements I would like to list here:

- Grade 8: **[First prize](<G8_1st Provincial Excellent Student.jpg>)** in the Provincial Excellent Student Contest.
- Grade 9: **[First prize](<G9_1st Provincial Youth IT.jpg>)** in the Provincial Youth IT Contest; **[Third prize](<G9_3rd National Youth IT.jpg>)** in the *National* Youth IT Contest.
- Grade 10: **[Gold medal](<G10_Gold medal 30-4 Olympic southern region.jpg>)** in the 30/4 Olympic exam for the *southern region* - Vietnam ([view exam](<exams/exam Olympic G10.pdf>)).

- Work at Viettel Solutions: **Third prize** in Hackathon Backend Code Challenge 2023 ([view HackerRank leaderboard](https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/backend-code-challenge/leaderboard)).

I also combined the tree data structure with the Flutter framework and created a package to visualize the inheritance tree. Reference: [recursive_tree_flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/recursive_tree_flutter).

There are also many Math awards that I have [here](Math). I don't list the awards at the District level because they would be too many.

Best regards,
