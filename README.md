Dear recruiter,

Thank you for taking the time to review my profile. If you're reading this, you're likely interested in learning more about me. I firmly believe that companies that prioritize candidates' Data Structures & Algorithms abilities are often the top-tier companies in the market. It's reassuring to know that.

As such, this repository will serve as a showcase of the achievements I've attained throughout my studies. I hope these accomplishments impress you, and perhaps even lead you to consider bypassing the LeetCode or HackerRank tests during the interview process :D Thank you!

Some IT achievements I would like to list here:

- Grade 8: **First prize** in the Provincial Excellent Student Contest.
- Grade 9: **First prize** in the Provincial Youth IT Contest; **Third prize** in the *National* Junior IT Competition for non-specialists.
- Grade 10: **Gold medal** in the 30/4 Olympic exam for the *southern region* - Vietnam ([view the exam](G10_exam.pdf)).
- Grade 11: **Bronze medal** in the 30/4 Olympic exam for the *southern region* - Vietnam ([view the exam](G11_exam.pdf)); **Third prize** in the Provincial Excellent Student Competition.
- Bach Khoa University at HCMC: **Third prize** of the 2019 Pascal Descendants Contest co-organized by the School with TEKO; Reached **the semi-final** of Code Tour x Uni co-organized by the School with VNG.
- Work at Viettel Solutions: Third prize in Hackathon Backend Code Challenge 2023 ([view leader board](https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/backend-code-challenge/leaderboard)).

There are also many Math awards that I have [here](Math). I don't list the awards at the District level because they would be too many.

Best regards,
