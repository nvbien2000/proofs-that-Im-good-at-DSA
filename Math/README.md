Some Math achievements I would like to list here:

- Grade 4, 6, 7, 8: **2nd prize** in the Provincial Violympic Internet Math Contest.
- Grade 5: **3rd prize** in the Provincial "Rung chuông vàng" Contest; Recognized as excellent elementary school student at the provincial level.
- Grade 9: **1st prize** in the Provincial Violympic Internet Math Contest; **Consolation prize** in the Provincial Math Excellent Student Contest; **2nd prize** in the Provincial Casio Math Contest; **Bronze medal** in the *National* Violympic Internet Math Contest.

I don't list the awards at the District level because they would be too many.
